        <p>
            Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of 
            the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon 
            Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes 
            involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal 
            relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.
