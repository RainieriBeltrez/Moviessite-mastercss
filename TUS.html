        <b>The Usual Suspects</b>
        <p>
            "The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist," says con man Kint 
            (Kevin Spacey), drawing a comparison to the most enigmatic criminal of all time, Keyser Soze. Kint 
            attempts to convince the feds that the mythic crime lord not only exists, but is also responsible for 
            drawing Kint and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San 
            Pedro Harbor - leaving few survivors.
