    <b>Interstellar</b>

    In the near future around the American Midwest, Cooper, an ex-science engineer and pilot, is tied to his farming land 
    with his daughter Murph and son Tom. As devastating sandstorms ravage Earth's crops, the people of Earth realize 
    their life here is coming to an end as food begins to run out. Eventually stumbling upon a N.A.S.A. 
    base near Cooper's home, he is asked to go on a daring mission with a few other scientists into a wormhole 
    because of Cooper's scientific intellect and ability to pilot aircraft unlike the other crew members. 
    In order to find a new home while Earth decays, Cooper must decide to either stay, or risk never seeing his children again 
    in order to save the human race by finding another habitable planet.
